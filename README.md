# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

Description of the APP;
This is a basic calendar application where the current timeslots refer to a normal 9-5 workday. The current time is highlighted in red while the past is in grey, anything in the future is all highlighted in green. Each of the slots is accompanied by a save button that stores the content into a localstorage function and then displays that saved content when the page is refreshed. This is a simple calendar that does not do anything other than tell you the time or any past events that your might have put. It does not reset at the beginning of the day it should be only used for daily planning.

Build Status; The code is done with a dynamic mindset so that if the user wanted to expand their timeblocks it can be done with a simple modification to the html.
